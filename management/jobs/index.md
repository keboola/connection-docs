Most of the things done in Keboola run as background, asynchronous jobs.
For an overview of all jobs, running and finished, go to the **Jobs** section:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Jobs](/management/jobs/jobs.png)

All jobs are logged and their tracked history is virtually unlimited. Click on a job to see details on 

- what tables were imported (created by the job and imported into your Storage).
- what tables were exported (read from your Storage by the job).
- how many [credits](/management/project/limits/#project-power) were used by running the job.
- what events occurred during the job execution.
- what exact parameters were used for the job (this might be useful when working with the [API](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/jobs/#apis-for-working-with-jobs)).

## Searching the jobs log

Using the search box and advanced patterns you can easily find job based on various parameters. 

### Search attributes

| | Query |
|---|---|
| **Job status** | `status:success` |
| **User who created the job**   | `token.description:john.doe@company.com` |
| (Docker) **Component name**     | `params.component:keboola.ex-http` <br /> OR <br /> `component:docker params.component:keboola.ex-http` |
| **Config ID**       | `params.config:351711187` |
| **Duration**        | `durationSeconds:>120` |
| **Time started**   | `startTime:[2018-06-21 TO 2018-07-01]` |
| **Time finished**   | `endTime:[2018-06-21 TO 2018-07-01]` |
| **Component type**    | `component:transformation` <br /> *(possible values are `docker`, `transformation` and `orchestrator`)*  |

### Modifiers

| | Query |
|---|---|
| **Exclude some results**   | `-status:success` <br /> (Note the _minus sign_ before the query) |
| **Open ended time query**     | `endTime:[2018-06-21 TO *]` <br /> Show jobs after 21st June 2018. |

### Useful examples

| | Query |
|---|---|
| **Failed orchestrations**  | `component:orchestrator status:error` |
| **Long running non-successful orchestrations (more than 2 hours)**  | `component:orchestrator durationSeconds:>7200 -status:success` |
| **Orchestrations which ended with warning**  | `component:orchestrator status:warning` |
| **Failed transformations**  | `component:transformation status:error`  |
| **Failed jobs from Docker component HTTP data source connector**  | `params.component:keboola.ex-http status:error` <br />  |
| **Jobs from either HTTP data source or Google Sheets data destination connector** | `params.component:(keboola.ex-http OR keboola.wr-google-sheets)` |
| **All non-successful jobs from either HTTP or Google Sheets writer** | `params.component:(keboola.ex-http OR keboola.wr-google-sheets) AND -status:success` |

[Developers documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/jobs/).

## Running Jobs
Jobs are either run [manually from any configuration](/tutorial/) or automatically by the 
[Orchestrator](/orchestrator/) at a scheduled time. In either case, the typical life time of a job has the 
following states:

**waiting** --> **processing** --> **success**/**error**

Until a job is finished (i.e., it is waiting or processing), it can be terminated:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Terminate Job](/management/jobs/terminate-job.png)

*Note that a job is not terminated immediately upon clicking the **Terminate** button. Its termination usually takes 
a few seconds.*

In some cases, a job can have **child jobs**. They are identified by having their `RunId` delimited with
a dot --- e.g., `347371952.3473719650`. In this case, the job `3473719650` run is in fact a child
job to `347371952`. Terminating the parent job will automatically terminate the child job too. 
Terminating the child job will probably cause the parent to terminate or fail.

## Waiting Jobs
When a job is run, it is always put in the waiting state to wait for our **infrastructure** --- 
[worker](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/jobs/) to start executing it.
This usually takes anywhere from several seconds to a couple of minutes at most. 

There is one more reason for a job to be in the waiting state: **project parallelism limits**. 
Either the same configuration of the same component is already being executed, or the overall limit
of concurrently running jobs within a project was exceeded. That means that a job will be in 
the waiting state under the following conditions:

- If the total number of running jobs in the project is greater or equal to **10**.
- If there is already a running job of the **same configuration**.
    - Unless it is a transformation job, in which case the same configuration is allowed to run, provided that it is executed by different [tokens](/management/project/tokens/).

## Storage Jobs
Not only we record all jobs executed in your Keboola project, we also record all data that was uploaded
into it. Go to **Storage** and click the **Jobs** tab:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Storage Jobs](/management/jobs/storage-jobs.png)

When you click an **importTable** job, you'll see the Storage job detail:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Storage Job Detail](/management/jobs/storage-jobs-detail.png)

Clicking **File ID** will take you to the **Files** section in **Storage**,
where all data pushed into your Keboola project is stored.
You can download the data and import it into other tables, or you can revert to an older table version.
