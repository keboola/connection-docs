In Keboola, customers are provided with three levels of detail for telemetry data and two ways to use the data. 
The first way is the [Telemetry Data source connector](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/), which is used to get the raw data for further analysis. 
The second way is [Telemetry dashboards](/management/telemetry/telemetry-dashboards), which are available in Keboola projects after clicking on the profile picture in the top right corner.

Three modes are available for data and the visual form: project mode, organization mode, and activity center mode. More details on the raw data modes can be found in these links: 
- [Project mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#project-mode-tables)
- [Organization mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#organization-mode-tables)
- [Activity Center mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#activity-center-mode-tables)

For the visual part, go to [Telemetry Dashboards](/management/telemetry/telemetry-dashboards).
