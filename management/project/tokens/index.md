All operations in a Keboola project must be authorized. This is technically done using **API tokens**
(also called **Storage API tokens**, **SAPI tokens**, and **Storage tokens**). 

Keboola is built using the [API-first approach](https://apigee.com/about/tags/api-first-0); almost every 
operation done in Keboola is in fact an API call and uses an API token. A token is valid only within 
a **single project** (hence the name Storage API token). 

Apart from API tokens, there are also [management tokens](/management/account/#tokens), which are used 
to perform operations outside individual projects.

Normally, when you are using the user interface, your API token is exchanged automatically with
the server backend. Therefore you need to work with tokens only when working with Keboola programmatically 
(or if you need to limit a user's authorization to certain operations or data). 
To learn more about all the available programmatic approaches, please follow our 
[developers documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/api/).

Tokens can be managed from the **Project Settings > API Tokens** page.

## Master Tokens
Tokens that belong to project administrators are called **master tokens**. Their description is 
the email of the user they belong to. Master tokens cannot be modified, shared or deleted. 
The only way to delete a master token is by [removing the user](/management/project/users/#removing-a-user) 
from the project on the **Project Settings > Users** page. 

A single user has only a single master token. In addition, master tokens are the only ones which can be 
used to create other tokens. A master token has always access to all components, so having it allows you 
to do everything that can be otherwise done via the Keboola administration user interface.

## Working with Tokens
API tokens are created

1. automatically when joining a project (master token).
2. automatically when creating a new configuration of certain components (for example, orchestrations).
3. automatically when running a JupyterLab workspace.
4. automatically when using [external OAuth](/components/#external-authorization) authorization.
5. manually when needed.

Automatically created tokens have the lowest possible permissions for their task and also set expiration if possible.
These are the typical reasons to manually create a new API token:

- You want to use the [APIs](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/api/); this includes all of the [Storage clients](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/#storage-api-clients).
- You need to limit access to certain data (for example, share a single table) or components.

Although tokens cannot be used to directly log in to the Keboola user interface, they do allow executing almost all 
operations in a Keboola project. As such, they must be treated as secret. Therefore the token 
string is shown only when the token is created and it is not accessible later. You should 
immediately [refresh a token](#refreshing-a-token) in case there is a suspicion that the 
token string was revealed to unauthorized persons.

When creating a new token, the following rules apply:

- Tokens by default give **no access** to any of the Keboola component configurations.
- Token bearers can only access **permitted** Storage buckets via the [Storage API](http://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/) or
[Storage console](https://storage-api-console.keboola.com/). 
- Tokens **cannot** be used to run any actions in your project. However, they can trigger orchestrations.
- Tokens **cannot** be used to create other tokens (only a master token can be used to create new tokens).

You should never share the same token in multiple applications. The number of tokens is not 
limited in any way, and there are no charges associated with them. Therefore, every time you need to provide
someone with a Keboola token, create a new one.

## Token Events
Keboola also tracks all operations performed by each token. You can view the list of events from 
the token detail page. Click on the token you are interested in:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Token List](/management/project/tokens/token-list.png)

In the **Events** tab, you can see all operations performed by that token:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Token List](/management/project/tokens/events.png)

You can also see changes to the token itself (e.g., permission changes).

***Note:** The history of token operations is kept for **6 months**. If you are interested in 
events associated with a particular storage object, view the events in [Storage](/storage/).*

## Limited Tokens
To add users with access limited to only some of your data, create a new token:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Access Tokens](/management/project/tokens/access-tokens.png)

Limit access of that token to a single Storage bucket, for instance, `in.c-csv-import`.
You can also limit the token validity.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Access Tokens](/management/project/tokens/access-token-detail.png)

You can see and copy the token only once --- right after it was created. If you
need to access the token later, you can [share it](#sharing-token).

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Access Tokens](/management/project/tokens/access-token-detail-2.png)

Token details can be accessed and updated on the token detail page anytime.

## Limited Access to Components
For production use, it is recommended not to give away your master token but to create **dedicated** tokens for
different uses. This also simplifies refreshing tokens as it is clear for what each token is used.

For example, suppose that you need to trigger data extraction from a MySQL database from within your own environment.
You would then create a token that is authorized for running the **MySQL database source connector** (`keboola.ex-db-mysql` component) and
**write** access to the `in.c-csv-import` bucket (which is used as a destination in the particular configuration you want to run).

![Screenshot - Component limited token](/management/project/tokens/component-limited.png)

*Note: For historical reasons, specifying the Orchestrator component in component permissions is optional. 
This means that the token will also work if it has access to no components.*

You can then [share the token](#sharing-a-token) to the person responsible for the database process and be 
sure that they can use only that particular component in that particular bucket. They will be even able to 
reconfigure it --- e.g., update the extraction queries (but only via the API).
Also, writing to a limited set of buckets is a good way of preventing accidentally overwriting data.

You can also specify if a token is allowed to delete configurations in [Trash](/components/#delete-configuration) by 
selecting **Full Access** for Trash. This is rarely needed.

## Refreshing Token
Every token can be **refreshed**: a new token value (token string) is generated, and the old token becomes 
immediately invalid. That means you have to update all places where the token was used.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Refresh Token Button](/management/project/tokens/refresh-token.png)

A confirmation dialog is displayed. When you click **Refresh**, the old token will become invalid.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Refresh Token Detail](/management/project/tokens/refresh-token-detail.png)

A new token is generated. Now you can copy it or send it to someone.

## Sharing Token
An existing token can be shared to an arbitrary email address (including yours). You can
share a token by clicking the **Send Token** button. Note that master tokens cannot be shared. 

**Important:** Always use the **Send Token** feature instead of copying and sending the token yourself. 
This is more secure because it does not actually send the token, only a link to retrieve it.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Access Tokens](/management/project/tokens/send-token-button.png)

A message can be added to the email.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Send Token](/management/project/tokens/send-token.png)

The recipient will obtain an email with an invitation link leading to the following screen:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Token Welcome Screen](/management/project/tokens/token-welcome.png)

Only the buckets you made accessible will be accessible by the token. If you set the token to expire, 
it will get deleted automatically after the specified period. In addition to sharing sections of 
your data with selected users, the buckets can be also used for writing;
people can send data directly to your Keboola project instead of struggling with FTP or e-mail attachments.
To revoke the access, simply delete or refresh the token.

The token can then be used with the [Storage API](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/) 
or [other APIs](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/api/). 

### Storage Console
Typical usecase of sharing a token with someone is giving them a partial access to your project storage. The 
project can be accessed via a **Storage API Console**. All that is needed to enter the console is 
a valid Token.

The Storage Console allows some basic operations with the project [Storage](/storage/) such as table or file uploads and downloads.

{: .image-popup}

The link to the Storage API Console is available at the token retrieval page as it is different for each 
[region](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/api/):
