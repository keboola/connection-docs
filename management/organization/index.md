Organizations are containers for [KBC Projects](/management/#project-status). Depending on your contract
details and permissions, the organizations feature may or may not be available to you.

To see the organization a project is assigned to, go to **Users & Settings** --- the 
**Settings** tab. To see all organizations you are a member of, go to **Account Settings** .

*Note: If you do not see the `Organizations` section in your account settings, 
you are not a member of any organization.*

Each organization is assigned to a **Maintainer** (either Keboola or Keboola Partner), 
who is also primarily responsible for L1 support unless agreed otherwise. 

All organization members are full members and as such can **add and remove** other members.

Newly added members get an email confirmation and if without a KBC account, 
they are [invited to create one](/management/users/#new-user). 
Removed members receive an email notification. 

Apart from adding and removing other members, each organization member is also allowed to do the following:

- Leave the organization; there is no way back without someone else's invitation.
- Leave and re-enter all existing projects in the organization. 
- View and edit billing details. 
- Manage [shared buckets](/storage/buckets/sharing/).
- Create new projects. 

To create a new project, click the *New Project* button, enter the project's name and select *project template*. 
Project templates differ mainly in the project expiration time. Some may be subject to billing.
