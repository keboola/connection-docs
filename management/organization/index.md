Organizations are containers for [KBC Projects](/management/#project-status). Depending on your contract
details and permissions, the organizations feature may or may not be available to you.

*Note: If you do not see the `Organizations` section in your account settings, 
you are not a member of any organization.* 

To see the organization a project is assigned to, go to **Users & Settings** --- the 
[**Settings** tab](/management/project/). To see all organizations you are a member of, go to [**Account Settings**](/management/account/).

Each organization is assigned to a **Maintainer** (either Keboola or Keboola Partner), 
who is also primarily responsible for L1 support unless agreed otherwise. 

All organization members are full members and as such can **add and remove** other members. 
Howver being a member of a project in an organization does not make you automatically 
member of the organization. That means each organization member has to be added or removed manually. 
The same goes for maintainers.

Newly added members get an email confirmation and if without a KBC account, 
they are [invited to create one](/management/project/users/#new-user). 
Removed members receive an email notification. 

Apart from adding and removing other members, each organization member is also allowed to do the following:

- Leave the organization; there is no way back without someone else's invitation.
- Leave and re-enter all existing projects in the organization. 
- View and edit billing details. 
- Manage [shared buckets](/storage/buckets/sharing/).
- Create new projects. 
- Allow [Keboola Support](/management/support/#require-approval-for-support-access) to join your projects.

To create a new project, click the *New Project* button, enter the project's name and select *project template*. 
Project templates differ mainly in the project expiration time. Some may be subject to billing.
