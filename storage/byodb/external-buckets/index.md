If you operate Keboola in Bring-Your-Own-Database (BYODB) mode using your own data warehouse, the data in the warehouse won't automatically be visible or accessible within Keboola. To address this, we offer the **External Datasets** feature.

The implementation of **External Datasets requires the [BYODB](https://help.keboola.com/storage/byodb/) to be enabled first**.
Unless specified otherwise, this description refers to the implementation of Snowflake and BigQuery.

## What Is an External Dataset?
Storage in Keboola is organized into [buckets](/storage/buckets/). An external dataset is a special type of bucket wherein Keboola does not manage 
its content. It can be located _anywhere in the storage backend used by your Keboola project_ (Snowflake or BigQuery) and is a virtual bucket connected 
to a Snowflake schema or BigQuery dataset, respectively.

All table-like objects (such as tables, views, and external tables) inside the schema (in Snowflake)
or dataset (in BigQuery) are mapped to tables in the bucket. Access to the bucket is read-only; you cannot write to the bucket from Keboola. A single schema can 
be registered simultaneously with multiple projects in Keboola.

## Creating an External Dataset
An external dataset can be registered in the Storage of a project. Go to **Storage > Register External Dataset**. The dialog will differ based on the 
backend you are using.

### Snowflake
Fill in the **name** of the new bucket, **database** name, and **schema** name. Click **Next Step**. Keboola will then generate a code that you can use to 
grant Keboola correct access to the schema in your Snowflake. Once access has been granted, click **Register Dataset** to start using it.

{: .alert.alert-info}
**Note:** This set of permissions grants the Keboola service account read-only access to the data.

{: .alert.alert-warning}
[Sharing data via Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-sharing) is currently not supported. Attempting to grant permissions will result in an error.

### BigQuery
Fill in the **name** of the new dataset and **dataset** name. Click **Next Step**. Keboola will generate a code that you can use to grant Keboola 
correct access to the dataset in BigQuery. Once access has been grated, click **Register Dataset** to start using it.

{: .alert.alert-info}
**Note:** By adding the Keboola service account as a subscriber, you enable read-only access to the data.

### BigLake Tables
Keboola generaly does not support external tables, except for [BigLake tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-storage-table-biglake). 
Please ensure that any table you are using is of this type. External tables of other types will not work in transformations and workspaces due to permission issues.

Please ensure that you can perform a `SELECT * FROM <table> LIMIT 1` query on your created BigLake table. Keboola checks this during the registration process. 
If the `SELECT` fails, the table will be skipped. 

The only exceptions are tables configured with `require_hive_partition_filter=true`. Such configurations of BigLake tables are supported by Keboola, but 
`SELECT` operations (like Data Preview) will fail. This is expected behavior. You can still use these tables in your workspaces and transformations, but 
appropriate `WHERE` conditions are necessary.

### Using an External Dataset

When you register an external dataset, we analyze the metadata of the objects in it and register all tables and views as tables in the Keboola Storage bucket. 
If you later add additional tables or views, you must manually **refresh** the Storage bucket using the **Refresh** action in the bucket detail to make them 
visible in Keboola.

External datasets cannot be used in an [input mapping](/transformations/mappings/#input-mapping)
They are accessible via the [read-only input mapping](/transformations/mappings/#read-only-input-mapping). 
Keep in mind that external buckets cannot be used in an [output mapping](/transformations/mappings/#output-mapping) as they are not writable.

### External Dataset in a Snowflake SQL Transformation
External datasets cannot be used in an input mapping as they are not copied into your transformation 
workspace. You need to reference them in your transformation using a fully qualified name.

In the following example, it is assumed that you've created an external dataset called `users-reporting` that references the `sales_emea` schema in the database 
`REPORTING`. The schema contains a table called `users`. Now you want to create a new table `MQL_USERS` that contains only users sourced from 
marketing-qualified leads. You can do that using the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "MQL_USERS" AS SELECT * 
FROM "REPORTING"."sales_emea"."users"
WHERE "source" = 'mql';
```

{: .alert.alert-warning}
**Note:** The query uses the **fully qualified name** of the table in the `FROM` clause.

### External Dataset in a BigQuery SQL Transformation
For BigQuery, an external dataset is mapped to an actual dataset, `users_reporting` (the name you filled in the dialog), in your project—in this case, project `sapi-9752`. You can reference the contents of the dataset in your SQL transformation using a fully qualified name: 

```bigquery
CREATE TABLE `MQL_USERS` AS SELECT *
FROM `users_reporting`.`users`
WHERE `source` = "mql";
```

{: .alert.alert-warning}
**Note:** The dataset name is the name of the bucket you provided in the dialog (`users-reporting`), not the original dataset created in BigQuery 
(`sales_emea`). However, there are no technical limitations; they can have the same name. 

## Sharing an External Dataset
It is possible to share a Snowflake external dataset using the same process as [any other Storage bucket](https://help.keboola.com/catalog/#enable-sharing). Once the bucket is shared, the refresh operation is only available in the source project (the project where the external dataset was registered). Currently, it is possible to share entire buckets, not specific tables within them.

{: .alert.alert-warning}
**Note:** At this time, sharing an external dataset is only possible on projects with a Snowflake storage backend. Sharing external datasets on a BigQuery storage backend isn't supported yet. If this is relevant to your use case, please create a support ticket.

## Removing an External Dataset
Removing an external dataset is as simple as removing any other Storage bucket. Simply delete it in the UI or via API. The Storage bucket will be removed from 
the project, but the schema in the database will remain untouched. Any rights that you have granted to Keboola during the registration will be revoked. 

If you wish to remove the schema, you must do so manually in your warehouse. 

### Usage Recommendations

* Use external datasets to work with data in your warehouse that has been produced by third-party tools outside Keboola.
* Use external datasets to access data in table-like structures that are not directly supported by Keboola (e.g., views and external tables).
* Using external datasets to load data from services with existing components into Keboola is **discouraged**. Consider the following limitations of such an approach:
    * You would have to orchestrate, maintain, and monitor the external pipeline, which Keboola normally does for you.
    * Manipulation of the data will not be tracked in the Keboola audit trail.
    * Event-driven triggering is not supported for external datasets, so you must manually synchronize the external and Keboola pipelines based on time.
* While there are legitimate uses of external tools, keep in mind that by having data pipelines outside Keboola, you lose the main benefit of Keboola—the ability to orchestrate, maintain, monitor, and audit the pipelines in one place.

## Limitations

* Table names can't be longer than **92 characters** and can contain only **alphanumeric** characters, **dashes**, and **underscores**. Tables that do not meet these requirements **will be ignored**.
* Table names are not case-sensitive. You cannot create two tables with the same name that differ only in letter case.
* [Creating snapshots](https://keboola.docs.apiary.io/#reference/table-snapshotting/create-or-list-snapshots/create-table-snapshot) from tables in external buckets is not supported.
* A read-only input mapping with an external dataset has a limitation. If you delete and recreate a registered table in the source schema, our [read-only input mapping](/transformations/workspace/#read-only-input-mapping) will lose access to this table. This occurs because we aim to limit clients from having excessive permissions, such as [OWNERSHIP](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege#restrictions-and-limitations), on their external schemas. **However, manually refreshing the bucket addressess this issue.** <br> To permanently resolve this issue, you can manually grant the read-only input mapping role future access to your tables as illustrated below: <br> `GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA "REPORTING"."sales_schema" TO ROLE KEBOOLA_8_RO` <br> 
Ensure the role name follows the pattern in the picture and is suffixed with _RO.
