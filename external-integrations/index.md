Keboola's external integration capabilities let you seamlessly extend the platform with your existing tools and workflows. By connecting to Keboola through our [REST API](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/api) or [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](/ai/mcp-server/) server, you can orchestrate data pipelines, trigger jobs, and embed Keboola into a broader automation ecosystem.

> Keboola integrates with external tools at multiple levels, from low-level API access to ready-made workflow platforms. This flexibility allows you to choose the approach that best fits your team's needs.

## Overview

External integrations make it simple to connect Keboola with other platforms and services. Whether you want to trigger data pipeline runs from external systems, enrich data with AI tools, or orchestrate workflows across multiple services, Keboola provides flexible ways to integrate:

### REST API

Full programmatic access to Keboola’s features, allowing you to automate, monitor, and manage data pipelines at scale.

### MCP Server

Model Context Protocol integration that lets AI agents and external tools communicate directly with your Keboola project.

### Workflow & Automation Tools

In addition to direct REST API and MCP access, Keboola can be connected to workflow automation platforms such as [n8n](/external-integrations/n8n).

These platforms provide ready-made connectors for Keboola, making it easier to design workflows without custom code. More integrations will be added over time.
