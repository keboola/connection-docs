Keboola CLI (Command Line Interface) is a set of commands to operate your cloud data pipeline. It is available 
to install in Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

The whole Keboola project is represented by a [directory structure](/cli/structure/#directory-structure). Each 
component configuration is represented as a directory and can be copied & pasted arbitrarily in the project 
and between other projects.
