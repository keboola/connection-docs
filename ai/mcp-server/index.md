## Overview  
Keboola's MCP Server brings powerful AI agents like Claude and Cursor directly into your data workflows. Just describe what you need in plain language to:

- Search and explore your data.
- Set up and manage workflows — no code required.
- Build SQL queries and transformations using AI.
- Launch and monitor jobs in real time.
- Automatically document everything — down to the column level.


**Business Use Cases:**
- Analyze customer orders, segment users, or monitor campaign performance — just by describing what you need, your assistant will query the data in your project directly.
- Instantly get data from any system (CRM, ERP, ads) without touching the UI.
- Update and run data pipelines before key meetings — no technical help required.
- Automatically generate clear, human-readable descriptions down to the column level for full data transparency.

## Connecting to Keboola's MCP Server

Keboola MCP Server is hosted on every multi-tenant stack and supports OAuth authentication. You can use the remote server in any AI Assistant that supports remote Streamable HTTP connection and OAuth authentication.

### Remote Server Setup

In case your AI assistant supports remote connection, you can connect to Keboola's MCP Server by following these steps:

1. Obtain the remote server URL of the stack `https://mcp.<YOUR_REGION>.keboola.com/mcp`.
   - Available stack URLs:
     - `https://mcp.keboola.com/mcp` 
     - `https://mcp.us-east4.gcp.keboola.com/mcp` 
     - `https://mcp.eu-central-1.keboola.com/mcp` 
     - `https://mcp.north-europe.azure.keboola.com/mcp`
     - `https://mcp.europe-west3.gcp.keboola.com/mcp`
   - You can find the url in your Keboola [Project Settings](/management/project/) under the tab `MCP Server`
     - In there you can also find specific instructions for various clients.
2. Copy the server URL and paste it into your AI assistant's settings.
3. Once you save the settings and refresh your AI assistant, you will be prompted to authenticate with your Keboola account and select the project you want to connect to.

For other options of local deployments see the [Developers Documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/mcp/#running-keboola-mcp-server-locally-using-uv-command).


### Using with Claude Desktop

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>These steps must be done by a Claude organization owner or primary owner, or on either a Claude Pro or Claude Max plan. The added integration will be available to all users in the Claude organization, but each user will still be required to authenticate themselves separately.</p>
</div>

- Go to [Settings > Integrations](https://claude.ai/settings/integrations)
- Click the **"Add more"** button
- Give the integration a name (Keboola) and paste in your Integration URL
  - `https://mcp.<YOUR_REGION>.keboola.com/mcp`
- Click **"Add"**
- You'll be prompted to authenticate with your Keboola account and select the project you want to connect to.

#### Via mcp-remote adapter

If you don't have a paid version you can still use the [`mcp-remote`](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) adapter to connect Claude Desktop to Keboola's MCP Server.

> NOTE: This method requires you to have Node.js installed on your computer. For more information refer to the [Developers Documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/mcp)

2. Click on **"Developer"** in the left-hand bar of the Settings pane, and then click on **"Edit Config"**
3. Paste the following JSON into the config file and save.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keboola": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.<YOUR_REGION>.keboola.com/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }

4. **MCP Server URL**: This is the most important part. You need the specific URL for your Keboola MCP Server:
   - Open a new tab and go to your Keboola [project settings](/management/project/)
   - Navigate to `Users & Settings` > `MCP Server`
   - Copy the MCP Server URL provided there (e.g., `https://mcp.us-east4.gcp.keboola.com/mcp`)
   - Paste this URL into the **MCP Server URL** field in ChatGPT
5. **Authentication**: The authentication method will be set to OAuth automatically
6. Check the box to confirm you understand the "beta" nature of custom connectors
7. Click **Create**

#### Step 4: Authorize the Connection

1. After clicking "Create," you will be redirected to the Keboola platform to authorize the connection
2. Sign in to your Keboola account if prompted
3. Select the specific Keboola project you want to connect to
4. Once authorized, you will be redirected back to ChatGPT
5. A confirmation message "Keboola is now connected" will appear at the top of the screen

#### Step 5: Use the Connector in a Chat

To use the custom connector you've created, you must explicitly enable Developer Mode in the chat interface:

1. Start a new chat
2. Click on the **"Add photos & files"** icon
3. Hover over the **"More"** option
4. From the expanded menu, select **"Developer Mode"**
5. This will change the prompt box to indicate that developer mode is active
6. You will see an option to select your custom connector (e.g., a button labeled "Keboola")
7. Click on the **"Keboola"** button to enable it for this specific conversation

You can now ask questions related to your Keboola data, and ChatGPT will use the connector to access the information. For example: "What data tables are in my project?" or "Show me the latest job runs."
