Kai is Keboola's embedded AI assistant—a context-aware data engineering co-pilot that understands your project's transformations, flows, table schemas, and jobs.

## What Kai Can Do

**Analytics & Exploration** — Query databases, explore schemas, calculate metrics, and analyze trends.

**Integration Setup** — Configure extractors, destinations, and custom components. Manage authentication and packages.

**Coding** — Write and optimize SQL/Python transformations. Convert between languages.

**Troubleshooting** — Debug job failures, resolve configuration errors, and investigate data quality issues.

**Documentation** — Generate project documentation, update table descriptions, and create onboarding materials.

**Data Modeling** — Build analytical frameworks, dimensional models, and complex data structures.

## Why Use Kai?

**Context-aware** — Unlike generic AI tools, Kai reads your actual job logs, configurations, and data structures to provide specific solutions.

**No setup required** — Built into Keboola, already authenticated, understands your current location.

**Data engineering focus** — Deep knowledge of Keboola components, transformations, and best practices.
