This part of our tutorial will guide you through the process of writing data from KBC. 
You have learned to [manipulate data](/tutorial/manipulate/) in KBC using SQL, 
and have a denormalized table called `opportunity_denorm` ready in the `out.c-tutorial` storage bucket. 
This table is suitable to be loaded into [Tableau Analytics](http://www.tableau.com/). 

## Getting Started

**Before you proceed, have [Tableau Desktop](http://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) installed**.
If you want to try connection to Tableau Server, have credentials for that server as well. 
As an alternative, sign up for a free trial of [Tableau Online](http://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) to test it out.

Writing data from KBC into a business intelligence and analytics tool such as Tableau is very common. 
Writing data to GoodData BI is covered in the following [side step](/tutorial/write/gooddata/). 
However, keep in mind you can use the processed data in any way you wish.   

There are two options how to load the `opportunity_denorm` table into Tableau:

- Generating a [Tableau Data Extract (TDE)](http://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2014/7/understanding-tableau-data-extracts-part1) 
and loading it manually into Tableau Desktop, or
- Generating a TDE and loading it into Tableau Server, either manually or automatically.

In both cases, you need the Tableau writer in the **Writers** section of KBC. 

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Writers](/tutorial/write/writers-intro.png)

Each writer can have multiple **configurations**. Each configuration represents a combination of data and destination. 
To give an example, you only need a single configuration to write multiple tables into a single Tableau server. 
However, two configurations are needed when you want to write data to two servers, or 
have a set of data loaded manually and a different set automatically. 
Continue with **Create New Configuration**.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Writer](/tutorial/write/tableau-intro.png)

Name and **Create** the configuration.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Create Tableau Writer Configuration](/tutorial/write/tableau-create-config.png)

Add the tables you want to send to Tableau,

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Start configuration](/tutorial/write/tableau-config.png)

in our case, select the `out.c-tutorial.opportunity_denorm` table,

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Select table](/tutorial/write/tableau-select-table.png)

and specify a data type for each of its columns. 
The [data types](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/online/mac/en-us/datafields_typesandroles_datatypes.html)
represent the type of values stored in the columns. If you `IGNORE` a column, it won't be loaded
into Tableau at all.

Since most columns in the `opportunity_denorm` table are strings (characters), start 
with `Set All Types to:` and select `string` to set them quickly. 
Then **Preview** the content of each column and set its type accordingly.

![Screenshot - Table configuration](/tutorial/write/tableau-table-config-1.png)

If you are not sure how to set up the data types, consult the following screenshots:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Table configuration - Column types Part 2](/tutorial/write/tableau-table-config-3.png)

Save the configuration.

## Loading Data into Tableau Desktop 

Click on **Export tables to TDE** to export the data set, a single table so far, into a TDE file.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Writer - TDE](/tutorial/write/tableau-intro-2.png)

The TDE file will be generated by a background job. When a job is running, a small orange circle appears
under *Last runs*, along with RunId and other info on the job. Green is for success, red for failure. 
Click on the indicator, or the info next to it for more details.

Download the latest version of the Tableau Data Export to your local computer 
by clicking on the `out.c_tutorial.opportunity_denorm.tde` link. Then load it into Tableau Desktop.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Desktop Load](/tutorial/write/tableau-desktop-intro.png)

The data table gets loaded.

Create reports to your liking. For instance, use the precomputed opportunity probability class.

## Loading Data into Tableau Server

For multiple users and for automated processing, it is better to load your data into Tableau Server.
It can be done with your own server instance, as well as with the [Tableau Online server](http://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi). 
To connect to Tableau Server, **Setup Upload**:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Setup Upload](/tutorial/write/tableau-intro-3.png)

Set a new destination, 

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Set Destination](/tutorial/write/tableau-destination.png)

then select **Tableau Server**,

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Use Server](/tutorial/write/tableau-destination-server.png)

and set server credentials.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Set Credentials](/tutorial/write/tableau-destination-intro.png)

If connecting to your own Tableau instance, have the connection properties at the ready, or
ask your server administrator. If connecting to Tableau Online, find all the necessary 
information in the intro page URL:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Server Credentials](/tutorial/write/tableau-online-intro.png)

From the above Tableau Online page, extract the **Server URL** -- `https://10ay.online.tableau.com/`,
and the **Site** -- `odinovo`. Use an existing Tableau project, or create a new one.   

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Use Server](/tutorial/write/tableau-credentials.png)

After setting up the credentials, click on **Enable instant upload**. The TDE files are automatically
pushed to Tableau Server every time they are generated. 

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Set Instant Upload](/tutorial/write/tableau-destination-final.png)

Then go back to the **Write to Server** configuration and click on **Export Tables to TDE** one more time.
 
{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Load Data to Server](/tutorial/write/tableau-intro-4.png)

Again, a background job will be created, taking the `out.c-tutorial.opportunity_denorm` table from Storage,
converting it to a TDE file, and loading that file to your server. If the job finishes successfully, 
you will see a new data source added to the project:
 
{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Online DataSource](/tutorial/write/tableau-online-datasource.png)

You, and everyone else in your organization, can then use that data source from Tableau 
Desktop by connecting to your server.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Desktop Connect to Server](/tutorial/write/tableau-desktop-server.png)

See your data source here:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tableau Desktop Datasource](/tutorial/write/tableau-desktop-datasource.png)

Create charts and reports as usual, and publish them to other people. 

## Semi-final Note
This concludes the main steps of the KBC tutorial. You have learned to load data into **Storage**, 
manipulate it using **Transformations**, and load it into the target system using **Writers**. 

At this point, you can

- [return to the tutorial index](/tutorial/) for additional steps, or 
- take a brief side-step on how to set up a [writer to GoodData BI](/tutorial/write/gooddata/), or
- continue to [Setting up Automation](/tutorial/automate/), or just
- [talk to us](/).
