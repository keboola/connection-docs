In this part of our tutorial about development branches, you will prepare [component configurations](/components/) 
that manipulate tables and buckets in [Storage](/storage/). We will use those configurations in the following sections 
to see how branches work. 

You can create a configuration of any component in a branch, and the following steps are not strictly necessary -- you
can use branches in a completely empty project. However, the tutorial follows the typical scenario when you are using 
branches in a non-empty project.

## Prepare Production Configurations
Let's start with a data pipeline that pulls data about bitcoin prices and creates a list of top five days when the price 
was the highest. You will prepare the production configurations, so that you can try working with branches later.

Start by pulling the bitcoin data. To simplify this, you can download a [prepared CSV file](/tutorial/branches/bitcoin_price.csv) using the [HTTP data source connector](/components/extractors/storage/http/).

### Set Up Connector

Create a new [HTTP connector](/components/extractors/storage/http/) configuration. Fill in **Base URL** 
to `https://help.keboola.com`. Then add a new table to the connector, named `bitcoin_price`, and fill in the **Path** 
to `/tutorial/branches/bitcoin_price.csv`. **Table Name** should be `bitcoin_price`.

Run the connector, and verify that a new table `in.c-keboola-ex-http-682373219.bitcoin_price` was created.

***Note:** The number in your bucket name represents the configuration's ID and will be different from what you see 
on the screenshot.*

### Set Up Transformation 
Create a new [Snowflake transformation](/transformations/snowflake-plain/) named `Bitcoin`.

In the **Table Input Mapping** section, fill in the table `bitcoin_price` that you created by running the HTTP connector.

In **Table Output Mapping**, add a table `top_prices` that will be created in the transformation.

Finally, add a new code to `Block 1` named `Top prices` with the following query:

{% highlight sql %}
{% raw %}
CREATE TABLE "top_prices" AS SELECT * FROM "bitcoin_price" ORDER BY PRICE DESC LIMIT 5;
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Save the transformation and run it. Then verify that there is a new table `out.c-bitcoin.top_prices` containing 
five values from the source data -- dates and amounts from when bitcoin had the most value.

Now you have the production set up. In [the next section](/tutorial/branches/prepare-files/) of our tutorial, you'll set up 
a Python transformation using file storage. After that, you can give the branches a test run.
