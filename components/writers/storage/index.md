Writers export data from Keboola Connection (KBC) to external systems. The following extractors
allow to push data to generic storage services:

- [AWS S3](/components/writers/storage/aws-s3/) --- writes CSV files to a single AWS S3 bucket with additional postprocessing.
- [Dropbox](/components/writers/storage/dropbox/) --- writes CSV files to a Dropbox account.
- [Google Drive](/components/writers/storage/google-drive/) --- writes tables as CSV files or entire Google Sheet files.
- [Google Sheets](/components/writers/storage/google-sheets/) --- writes tables as individual sheets of a Google Sheet file, or appends rows to an existing sheet.
- [Keboola Connection Storage](/components/writers/storage/storage-api/) --- writes tables to a different Keboola Connection project; can be used where [Share Buckets](/storage/buckets/sharing/) cannot.
- and [others](https://components.keboola.com/components)
