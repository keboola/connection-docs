Data destination connectors are [Keboola components](/overview/) that take transformed and processed **output data from Keboola**
and deliver it **into its final destination:** the systems and applications where the data gets used/**consumed**.

## Types of Data Destination Connectors
We integrate your data into most of the top market systems.
Choose the right consumption point for each project and use case. Like with data source connectors,
there are **no limitations** to how and where you can send your data.

Data destination connectors can be grouped by their primary purpose:

- **Business Intelligence**: [Tableau](/components/writers/bi-tools/tableau/), [GoodData](/components/writers/bi-tools/gooddata/), [Looker](/components/writers/bi-tools/looker/), and more
- **Databases**: [MySQL](/components/writers/database/mysql/), [Oracle](/components/writers/database/oracle/), [PostgreSQL](/components/writers/database/postgresql/), [Amazon Redshift](/components/writers/database/redshift/), [Snowflake](/components/writers/database/snowflake/), [Synapse](/components/writers/database/synapse/), and more
- **Generic Storage**: [AWS S3](/components/writers/storage/aws-s3/), [Dropbox](/components/writers/storage/dropbox/), [Google Drive](/components/writers/storage/google-drive/),
[Google Sheets](/components/writers/storage/google-sheets/), [Keboola Connection Storage](/components/writers/storage/storage-api/), and more
- [Other](/components/writers/other/) data destination connectors such as Azure Event Hub

For a definitive list of usable data destination connectors, see your project **Data Destinations** section.

## Working with Data Destination Connectors
Each data destination connector can have multiple configurations. Each configuration usually represents a single destination (database account, BI project, etc.).
Even though destination connectors are generally designed for [**automated and repeated**](/orchestrator/) data collection,
they can be triggered manually at any time.
