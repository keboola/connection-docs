The [Microsoft Advertising (Bing Ads)](https://ads.microsoft.com/) data source connector supports the extraction of either campaign entity data or various types of
available reports. In the case of reports, you can specify your own set of columns and the primary key to use in Keboola Storage,
but there are also presets of columns and appropriate primary keys available.

## Prerequisites

Have your Bing Ads Account ID and Customer ID ready. Please
follow [this part of the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/get-started?view=bingads-13#get-ids). 
Both should be numbers in the format of `391827251`.

## Configuration

[Create a new configuration](/components/#creating-component-configuration) of the **Microsoft Advertising (Bing Ads)**
connector.

### Global Configuration

First log into your account using the **Authorize Account** button in the Keboola interface.

{: .image-popup}
![OAuth Authorization](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/config_oauth.png)

Then open the global configuration:

{: .image-popup}
![Global Configuration opening](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/global_config_collapsed.png)

Enter your Account ID and Customer ID into the component's global configuration, as shown in the screenshot below.
Don't forget to **save** the configuration.

### Configure Reports (Configuration Rows)

Now you can configure the reports to extract as configuration rows. First, click **Add Row**:

{: .image-popup}
![Add Row](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/add_row.png)

Next, select the **object type**:

- **Entity** to extract campaign entities (Ads, Ad Groups, Campaigns, etc.).
- **Report (Prebuilt)** to extract reports using one of the presets.
- **Report (Custom)** to extract reports using your own set of columns and the primary key.

{: .image-popup}
![Row object type entry](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/row_object_type.png)

The rest of the configuration depends on which **Object Type** is selected.

#### Prebuilt reports

This part of row configuration only becomes available if `Report (Prebuilt)` is selected as the **Object Type**. Here
you must set these options:

- **Preset Name** (preset_name) — Select one of the available report presets. The columns and the primary key that will be
  used for each preset are listed [here](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/report-presets-columns-and-pk/).
- **Report Aggregation** (aggregation) – The type of aggregation that needs to be used to aggregate the report data. For prebuilt
  report presets, only `Daily` and `Hourly` aggregation is available.
- **[Time Range](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/#specifying-time-range)**
- **Return only complete data** (return_only_complete_data) – Determines whether the service must ensure that all
  the data has been processed and is available. If checked and the requested data are (partially) incomplete or
  unavailable, an error will be raised.

#### Custom reports

This part of row configuration only becomes available if `Report (Custom)` is selected as the **Object Type**. Here you
must set these options:

- **Report Type** (report_type) – Select one of the available report types described in
  the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/report-types?view=bingads-13).
- **Report Aggregation** (aggregation) – The type of aggregation to use to aggregate the report data.
- **[Time Range](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/#specifying-time-range)**
- **Return only complete data** (return_only_complete_data) – Determines whether or not the service must ensure that
  all the data has been processed and is available. If checked and the requested data are (partially) incomplete or
  unavailable, an error will be raised.
- **Columns** (columns) – List of columns to use for the report. To reload the list of columns available for the
  selected report, click the **Re-Load Available Columns** button.
- **Primary Key Columns** (primary_key) – List of columns to be used as the primary key. The list will contain only columns
  that have been selected in the `columns` field. We recommend using dimension columns only and using ID columns
  where possible to avoid ambiguity in case the dimension name is changed.

#### Specifying time range

For reporting, it is possible to define the required time range. It can be either a fixed date or a relative period.

**Incremental fetching (true deltas)** can be achieved by setting the `Date From` to the `last run` value, which sets the reporting
period to cover the time since last extraction. Make sure to set the `Destination Load Type` to `Incremental Load` to
collect historical data.

**Parameters**

- **Report Time Zone** (time_zone) – Determines the time zone that is used to establish today's date. 
- **Report Period** (period) – The time period the report relates to. If `CustomTimeRange` you will also need to provide the
  following 2 parameters:
- **Date From** (date_from) – Start date of the report. Use the YYYY-MM-DD format or a human readable description, e.g.,
`5 days ago`, `1 month ago`, `yesterday`, etc. You can also enter `last run` to start the reporting period at the
  time of last extraction (this cannot be done in case of the first run for obvious reasons). 
- **Date To** (date_to) – End date of the report. Use the YYYY-MM-DD format or a human-readable description, e.g., `5 days ago`, `1 month ago`, `yesterday`, etc.

#### Entities extraction

This is useful for getting additional information about your campaigns or other entities. However, note that in most cases it
may be more convenient to include entity related columns in the report itself.

To download entities, select `Entity` **Object Type** and configure the following options:

- **Entities** – List of entities (or entity types) to download. To load a full list of entities available, click
  the **Re-Load Available Entities** button. Currently, only the extraction of entities within the `EntityData` data scope
  is supported. More information is available in
  the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/bulk-service/downloadentity?view=bingads-13#values)
  .
- **Only download changes since the last run** (since_last_sync_time) – If checked, only changes since the last
  component run will be downloaded. If checked for the first run of this component row, it will be ignored (i.e. all
  data will be downloaded).

{: .image-popup}
![Entities configuration entry](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/row_entities.png)

#### Destination

Finally, you must set how the extracted data will be saved in Keboola Storage.

- **Load Type** (load_type) – If Full Load is used, the destination table will be overwritten every run. If Incremental
  Load is used, data will be "upserted" into the destination table.
- **Storage Table Name** (output_table_name) – Name of the table stored in Storage. Defaults are used if left empty (see
  the [Output section](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/#output) for details).

{: .image-popup}
![Destination configuration entry](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/row_destination.png)

Once again, don't forget to **save**.

### Example Configuration

Let's say you want to download an AdGroupPerformance report
with [the preset columns and a primary key](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/report-presets-columns-and-pk/)
and upsert the data into a table called `AdGroupPerformance_Daily_Report`. In that case, you would:

1. set the **Object Type** to `Report (Prebuilt)`,
2. set the **Preset Name** to `AdGroupPerformance`,
3. set the **Report Aggregation** to `Daily`,
4. set the **Report Period** to `ThisYear`,
5. uncheck **Return only complete data** (since we are using `ThisYear` as the reporting period, not all data is
   available), and
6. set the **Load Type** to `Incremental Load`.

If needed, you can also change the **Report Time Zone**, of course. We can leave **Storage Table Name** empty since we
want the default table name of `AdGroupPerformance_Daily_Report`, but you can set your custom **Storage Table Name** if
needed.

## Output

The output of every configuration row is always a single table in the Keboola Storage. If you specify the **Storage
Table Name** in the [destination configuration](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/#destination), this name is used; otherwise, a default name is generated
as specified below.

### Entities

When extracting campaign entity data (i.e., when the **Object Type** in the row configuration is set to `Entity`), the default name of
the Keboola Storage output table is `entities`.

***Note:** Due to the API behaviour, the output table will always contain all 418 columns that are available for
all entity types, even though the entity is not selected for download. Columns relevant to unselected types will be empty.*

### Reports

#### Prebuilt

When extracting report data (i.e., when Object Type in row config is set to `Report (Prebuilt)`), the output table
schema depends on which report preset is specified in the Preset Name row configuration parameter and the chosen
aggregation in the Aggregation parameter. You can see which columns are extracted for each combination of Preset Name and
Aggregation [here](/components/extractors/marketing-sales/bing-ads/report-presets-columns-and-pk/). 
The default table name is constructed as `{preset_name}_{aggregation}_Report`, where `{preset_name}` is the Preset
Name parameter value and `{aggregation}` is the value of the Aggregation parameter.

#### Custom

When extracting report data (i.e., when Object Type in row config is set to `Report (Custom)`), the output table schema
depends on the columns set in the Columns parameter. The default table name is constructed as `{report_type}_Report`, 
where `{report_type}` is the Report Type parameter value specified in the row configuration.
