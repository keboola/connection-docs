This data source connector loads Excel sheets from 
**[Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage)**
and stores them as tables in a bucket in your current project.

**[Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage)**
cloud storage integrates
**[Office365](https://www.office.com/)**
and **[SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration)** sites,
so with this connector, you have access to all your Excel sheets in your personal account or in your business account.

[Create a new configuration](/components/#creating-component-configuration) of the **OneDrive Excel Sheets** connector.  
Then click **Authorize Account** to [authorize the configuration](/components/#authorization).

## Modify Configuration
When a table is added to the connector, it is displayed in the list of tables. 

Configured tables are stored as [configuration rows](/components/#configuration-rows).

Each table has a different setting, but all tables share the same authorization to your OneDrive account.

The list shows the row name and the destination table in [Storage](/storage/).

You can **click on the row to modify** the configuration.
