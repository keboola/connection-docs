A good security practice is to **block connections from unrecognized sources** on the network level
using a firewall or AWS security groups. This applies especially to the production database whose
connections should not be publicly available. For an extra layer of security, setting up an
[SSH Tunnel](/components/extractors/database/#connecting-to-database) is also recommended.

To access external systems (including your database), Keboola uses the below 
IP addresses. Please **whitelist** these IP addresses in your firewalls to allow Keboola 
to successfully connect to your system. This applies to all components including all data source and destination connectors.

**Important:** These IP addresses can change in the future! For your convenience, you can programmatically
fetch and process the [list of existing IP addresses in JSON format](/components/ip-addresses/kbc-public-ip.json).
Below are listed the available [Keboola Stack endpoints](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/api/#regions-and-endpoints).

For ease of identification, our outbound IP addresses on AWS stacks (except for legacy services) now have reverse DNS records. 
Each IP address has a unique name like `outbound-if-issue-contact-support-at-keboola-com.keboola.com`, embedding a reference for a support email. 
This enhancement helps us promptly tackle network issues or unauthorized access.

## IP Address Ranges in JSON
We are publishing our current IP addresses in JSON format. To view them,
download the [kbc-public-ip.json](/components/ip-addresses/kbc-public-ip.json) file.

To determine whether there have been changes since the last time you saved the file, check the publication
time in the current file (`syncToken` attribute) and compare it to the publication time in the last file you saved.

The JSON file contains an array of ranges (attribute `prefixes`), each of which has the following attributes:

 - `ipPrefix` — subnet mask (CIDR)
 - `vendor` — cloud service provider
 - `region` — cloud service region
 - `service` — Keboola application service
   - `queue` - for Keboola components
   - `email-delivery` - for outbound emails

### Sample JSON

{% highlight json %}
