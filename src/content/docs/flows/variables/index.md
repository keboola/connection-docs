description: Store and reuse values in Conditional Flows — static and dynamic variables, JMESPath aggregations, the COUNT and DATE functions, and how variables reach component jobs.
---

Variables in [Conditional Flows](/flows/) let you store and reuse values — like dates, task results, or custom inputs — throughout your flow. You can use them to make decisions, control flow logic, or pass dynamic values between tasks. The sections below walk through how to set up and use variables from the UI; each step also shows the JSON shape generated behind the scenes for template authors and API users.

## Adding a Variable

1. In a phase, click the **+** icon and choose **Variable**. The **Set Variable** panel opens on the right.
2. Enter a **Variable Name** — this is the identifier other tasks will use to reference the value.
3. Choose a **Variable Type** — either [Static Value](#static-value) or [Dynamic Value](#dynamic-value).

## Static Value

A **Static Value** is a fixed text or number you enter directly. Useful for thresholds, IDs, or labels that don't change between runs.

**JSON equivalent** (useful when authoring a flow as a template or via the API):

```json
{
  "type": "variable",
  "name": "max_duration",
  "value": 3600
}
```

## Dynamic Value

A **Dynamic Value** is computed at run time from a task result, an earlier phase, or a built-in function (see [Date & Time function](#date--time-function) below). When you pick this type, the value picker lets you browse the outputs of tasks that ran earlier in the flow. You can pick any field from the job's result tree — for example `result.output.tables`, `result.artifacts`, `result.images`, `result.configVersion`, `result.errorMessage`, and many more.

If a task produces **multiple output tables**, the picker also offers aggregations across all of them: **Sum**, **Minimum**, **Maximum**, and **Average** of a numeric field. For example, `Sum of importedRowsCount` returns the total number of rows imported by an HTTP data source across every output table.

:::caution
**Aggregations are not functions.** The Sum / Minimum / Maximum / Average options are not built-in functions — the `function` enum only accepts `COUNT` and `DATE`. The picker implements each aggregation as a [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) expression placed in the task `value` field rather than a `function` block. When authoring a flow via the API or as a template, write the aggregation directly in `value`:

- **Sum** → `sum(job.result.output.tables[].importedRowsCount)`
- **Minimum** → `min(job.result.output.tables[].importedRowsCount)`
- **Maximum** → `max(job.result.output.tables[].importedRowsCount)`
- **Average** → `avg(job.result.output.tables[].importedRowsCount)`
:::

**JSON equivalent** — behind the scenes the aggregation is stored as a `source` definition. For example, `Sum of importedRowsCount` can be expressed as a JMESPath aggregation in the task `value`. Note that the picker tree displays paths rooted at `result.*` (for example `result.output.tables`), while the generated `value` expression is rooted at `job.result.*`:

```json
{
  "type": "variable",
  "name": "total_imported_rows",
  "source": {
    "type": "task",
    "task": "extract-data",
    "value": "sum(job.result.output.tables[].importedRowsCount)"
  }
}
```

`COUNT` and `DATE` are the only functions exposed via the `function` block (see [Date & Time function](#date--time-function) below); they take their inputs as `operands`. `COUNT` counts the items a JMESPath expression returns — for example, the number of output tables a task produced:

```json
{
  "type": "variable",
  "name": "table_count",
  "source": {
    "type": "function",
    "function": "COUNT",
    "operands": [
      {
        "type": "task",
        "task": "extract-data",
        "value": "job.result.output.tables"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `value` field accepts [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) expressions, so you can filter and extract specific items from the task result instead of just walking the tree. For example, picking the name of a particular output table by its ID:

```json
{
  "type": "task",
  "task": "97288",
  "value": "job.result.output.tables[?id=='out.c-test.example'][].name | [0]"
}
```

## Date & Time function

Returns the date/time formatted according to the specified format string, available formats:
[https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php).

This example returns the full textual representation of the current month, such as "July" or "August".

```json
{
 "type": "function",
 "function": "DATE",
 "operands": [
   {
     "type": "const",
     "value": "F"
   }
 ]
}
```

**Example of creating a variable with the current timestamp:**

```json
{
 "id": "set-timestamp",
 "name": "Set Timestamp Variable",
 "phase": "init",
 "task": {
   "type": "variable",
   "name": "current_timestamp",
   "source": {
     "type": "function",
     "function": "DATE",
     "operands": [
       {
         "type": "const",
         "value": "U"
       }
     ]
   }
 }
}
```

## Using Variables in Conditions

Once a variable has been set in an earlier phase, any later **Condition** can compare its value against a constant, against another variable, or against a task result.

1. In the IF row, click the value picker and choose a variable, a task result, or a phase result from an earlier phase.
2. Choose an operator (Greater than, Equals, Contains, …).
3. Provide a comparison value — a constant, or another value picked from the tree.
4. Set the THEN and ELSE actions: **Continue To** an existing phase, or end the flow.

Only the first matching IF condition is executed; subsequent IFs in the same Conditions block are skipped.

See also the [Conditions](/flows/#conditions) section for the full list of operators and condition types.

## How Variables Reach Component Jobs

When a phase runs a component (a job task), the variables you set earlier in the flow are merged into the component's own variables. A flow variable replaces a component variable **only if both have the same name** — flow variables whose names the component does not declare are silently ignored. This means: to let a flow drive a value inside a component, declare a variable with the matching name in the component's configuration; the flow will fill it in when the job runs.

For finer control on a specific job task, an advanced `variableOverrides` field on the task can restrict which flow variables are merged in.
