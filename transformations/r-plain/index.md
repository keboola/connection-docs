[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) transformations are for **advanced statistical computations**.
Apart from ready-to-use implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms, R's other great assets are vector and matrix
computations. R transformations complement Python and SQL transformations where computations or
other operations are too difficult. Common data operations like joining, sorting, or grouping are still easier and
faster to do in [SQL Transformations](/transformations/#backends).

## Environment
The R script is executed in an isolated [environment](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/#component).
The current R version is **4.0.5**, however it is possible to switch your configuration to run on other versions if available.

Any updates to the R version is always announced in the Keboola [changelog](https://changelog.keboola.com/).

### Memory and Processing Constraints
An R transformation has a limit of 16GB of allocated memory and the maximum running time is 6 hours.
The CPU is limited to the **equivalent** of two 2.3 GHz processors.

### File Locations
The R script itself will be compiled to `/data/script.R`. To access your
[mapped input and output](/transformations/mappings/) tables, use
relative (`in/tables/file.csv`, `out/tables/file.csv`) or absolute (`/data/in/tables/file.csv`, `/data/out/tables/file.csv`) paths.
To access downloaded files, use the `in/files/` or `/data/in/files/` path. If you want to dig really deep,
have a look at the [full Common Interface specification](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/common-interface/).
Temporary files can be written to a `/tmp/` folder. Do not use the `/data/` folder for those files you do not wish to exchange with Keboola.

## R Script Requirements
You can organize your script into [blocks](/transformations/#writing-scripts), but the resulting R script to be run 
within our environment must meet the following requirements:

### Packages
The R transformation can use any package available on
[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html). In order for a package and
its dependencies to be automatically loaded and installed, list its name in the package section. Using `library()`
for loading is not necessary then.

The latest versions of packages are always installed. Some packages are pre-installed in the environment
(see [list](https://github.com/keboola/docker-custom-r/blob/master/init.R#L3)). These pre-installed packages are 
installed with their dependencies, therefore to get an authoritative list of installed packages use the `installed.
packages()` function. It does no harm if you add one of these packages to your transformation explicitly, but the transformation and 
sandbox startup will be slowed by the forced re-installation.

### CSV Format
Tables from Storage are imported to the R script from CSV files. The CSV files can be read by standard R functions.
Generally, the table can be read with default R settings. In case R gets confused, use the exact format
specification `sep=",", quote="\""`. For example:

{% highlight r %}
data <- read.csv("in/tables/in.csv", sep=",", quote="\"")
{% endhighlight %}

### Row Index in Output Tables
Do not include the row index in the output table (use `row.names=FALSE`). If you are using the
[readr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/readr.pdf), you can also use the `write_csv` function
which doesn't write row names.

{% highlight r %}
write.csv(data, file="out/tables/out.csv", row.names=FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

The row index produces a new unnamed column in the CSV file which cannot be imported to [Storage](/storage/).
If the row names contain valuable data, and you want to keep them, you have to convert them to a separate column first.

{% highlight r %}
df <- data.frame(first = c('a', 'b'), second = c('x', 'y'))
data <- cbind(rownames(df), df)
write.csv(data, file="/data/out/tables/out.csv", row.names=FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

### Errors and Warnings
We have set up our environment to be a little zealous; all warnings are converted to errors and they cause the
transformation to be unsuccessful. If you have a piece of code in your transformation which may emit warnings,
and you really want to ignore them, wrap the code in a `tryCatch` call:

{% highlight r %}
tryCatch(
{ ... some code ... },
warning = function(w) {}
)
{% endhighlight %}

## Dynamic Backends
If you have a large amount of data in databases and complex queries, your transformation might run for a couple of hours.
To speed it up, you can change the backend size in the configuration. R transformations suport the following sizes:
- XSmall
- Small _(default)_
- Medium
- Large

Scaling up the backend size allocates more resources to speed up your transformation, which impacts [time credits consumption](/management/project/limits/#project-power--time-credits).

***Note:** Dynamic backends are not available to you if you are on the [Free Plan (Pay As You Go)](/management/payg-project/).*

## Development Tutorial
We recommend that you create an [R Workspace](/transformations/workspace) with the same
input mapping your transformation will use. This is the fastest way to develop your transformation code.

**Tip:** Limit the number of rows you read in from the CSV files:

{% highlight r %}
mydata <- read.csv("in/tables/mydata", nrows=500)
{% endhighlight %}

This will help you catch annoying issues without having to process all data.

You can also develop and debug R transformations on your local machine.
To do so, [install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), preferably the same [version as us](#environment).
It is also helpful to use an IDE, such as the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org).

To simulate the input and output mapping, all you need to do is create the right directories with the right files.
The following image shows the directory structure:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Data folder structure](/transformations/r/tree.png)

The script itself is expected to be in the `data` directory; its name is arbitrary. It is possible to use relative directories,
so that you can move the script to a Keboola transformation with no changes. To develop an R transformation which takes
a [sample CSV file](/transformations/r/source.csv) locally, take the following steps:

- Put the R code into a file, for instance, script.R in the working directory.
- Put all tables from the input mapping inside the `in/tables` subdirectory of the working directory.
- Place the binary files (if using any) inside the `in/user` subdirectory of the working directory, and make sure
  that their name has no extension.
- Store the result CSV files inside the `out/tables` subdirectory.

Use this sample script:
{% highlight r %}
data <- read.csv(file = "in/tables/source.csv");

df <- data.frame(
col1 = paste0(data$first, 'ping'),
col2 = data$second * 42
)
write.csv(df, file = "out/tables/result.csv", row.names = FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

A complete example of the above is attached below in [data.zip](/transformations/r/data.zip).
Download it and test the script in your local R installation. The `result.csv` output file will be created.
This script can be used in your transformations without any modifications.
All you need to do is

- create a table in Storage by uploading the [sample CSV file](/transformations/r/source.csv),
- create an input mapping from that table, setting its destination to `source` (as expected by the R script),
- create an output mapping from `result.csv` (produced by the R script) to a new table in your Storage,
- copy & paste the above script into the transformation code, and finally,
- save and run the transformation.

### Events and Output
It is possible to output informational and debug messages from the R script simply by printing them out.
The following R script:

{% highlight r %}

print('doing something')
Sys.sleep(3)
print('doing something else')
Sys.sleep(3)
write('still doing something', stdout())
Sys.sleep(3)
write('error message', stderr())
Sys.sleep(3)
app$logInfo("information")
Sys.sleep(3)
app$logError("error")
Sys.sleep(3)
TRUE
{% endhighlight %}

produces the following events in the transformation job:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Script Events](/transformations/r-plain/events.png)

The `app$logInfo` and `app$logError` functions are also internally available; they can be useful if you need to know 
the precise server time of when an event occurred. The standard event timestamp in job events is the time when the event was received
converted to the local time zone.

### Going Further
The above steps are usually sufficient for daily development and debugging of moderately complex R transformations,
although they do not reproduce the transformation execution environment exactly. To create a development environment
with the exact same configuration as the transformation environment, use [our Docker image](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/docker/running/#running-transformations).

## Examples
There are more in-depth examples dealing with

- [array splitting](/transformations/r/array-splitter/),
- [plotting charts & graphs](/transformations/r/plots/), and
- [using trained models and binary files](/transformations/r/binary/).
