A good security practice is to **block connections from unrecognized sources** on the network level
using a firewall or AWS security groups. This applies especially to the production database whose
connections should not be publicly available. For an extra layer of security, setting up an
[SSH Tunnel](https://help.keboola.com/extractors/database/#connecting-to-database) is also recommended.

To access external systems (including your database), KBC uses the below IP addresses. Please **whitelist**
these IP addresses in your firewalls to allow KBC to successfully connect to your system. This applies to
all KBC components including all extractors and writers.

**Important:** These IP addresses can change in the future! For your convenience, you can programmatically
fetch and process the [list of existing IP addresses in JSON format](/extractors/ip-addresses/kbc-public-ip.json).
Below are listed the available [Keboola Connection Stack endpoints](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/api/#regions-and-endpoints).

## connection.keboola.com
For projects in the default US region (AWS region `us-east-1`), the following IP addresses are currently used:

- `34.224.0.188`
- `34.200.169.177`
- `52.206.109.126`
- `34.203.87.137`

## connection.eu-central-1.keboola.com
For projects in the EU region (AWS region `eu-central-1`), the following IP addresses are currently used:

- `35.157.170.229`
- `35.157.93.175`

## IP Address Ranges in JSON
We are publishing our current IP addresses in JSON format. To view them,
download the [kbc-public-ip.json](/extractors/ip-addresses/kbc-public-ip.json) file.

To determine whether there have been changes since the last time you saved the file, check the publication
time in the current file (`syncToken` attribute) and compare it to the publication time in the last file you saved.

The JSON file contains an array of ranges (attribute `prefixes`), each of which has the following attributes:

 - `ipPrefix` — subnet mask (CIDR)
 - `vendor` — cloud service provider
 - `region` — cloud service region
 - `service` — Keboola application service (`syrup` for Keboola Connection components)
