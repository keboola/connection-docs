This extractor loads a single or multiple CSV files from a single or multiple AWS S3 buckets and stores them in multiple tables in Storage. 
Compared to the [Simple AWS S3 extractor](/extractors/other/simple-aws-s3), it offers extensive CSV postprocessing 
and its UI gives you more flexibility.

After creating a new configuration, select the files you want to extract from AWS S3 and determine the way how 
you save them to KBC Storage. You also need to set up the proper permissions on AWS.

## Create New Configuration

Find the AWS S3 extractor in the list of extractors and create a new configuration. Name it.

## Setting AWS Credentials

In order to access the files in S3, you need to set up AWS credentials. 

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - AWS Credentials](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui2.png)

Use the AWS Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key with read permissions to the desired S3 bucket(s) and file(s). 
Make sure this AWS Access Key ID has the correct permissions:
 
 - `s3:GetObject` for the given key/wildcard
 - `s3:ListBucket` to access all wildcard files
 - `s3:GetBucketLocation` to determine the region of the S3 bucket(s)
 
You can add the following policy document as an inline policy to an AWS user:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/folder/*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket"
        }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Adding Tables

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Create table](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui3.png)

To create a new table, click the **New Table** button and assign a name. 
It will be used to create the destination table name in Storage and can be modified.
 
## Listing Tables

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - List tables](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui9.png)

The configuration can extract as many tables as you wish. 
The list is fully searchable, and you can delete or disable each table. In addition, you can explicitly run extraction of only one table. 
The extraction order of the tables can be changed.  

## Modifying Table

Each table has different settings (key, load type, etc.) but they all share the same AWS credentials. 

### Specifying Files to Download

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - S3 Settings](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui4.png)

For each table you have to specify the AWS S3 bucket and a search key. 
The search key can be a path to a single file or a prefix to multiple files 
(omit the wildcard character and use the **Wildcard** checkbox instead).

### Download Settings

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Download Settings](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui5.png)

This section allows you to set up the following:

 - **Wildcard**: S3 key is used as a prefix, and all available files matching the prefix will be downloaded. 
 - **Subfolders**: Available only with **Wildcard** turned on. The extractor will also process all subfolders.
 - **New Files Only** - The extractor will keep track of downloaded files and will continue with the unprocessed files 
 on the next run. To reset the state, which keeps track of the progress and enables to continue with new files, use the **Reset State** button.
 - **Decompress**: All downloaded files will be decompressed (currently supporting ZIP and GZIP). All files in all archives >>>>>>> Stashed changes
 will be imported into a single Storage table.

### Save Settings

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Save Settings](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui6.png)

- The initial value in **Table Name** is derived from the configuration table name. You can change it at any time; however, 
the [Storage bucket](/storage/buckets/) where the table will be saved to cannot be changed.
- **Incremental Load** will turn on [incremental loading to Storage](/storage/tables/#incremental-loading). The result of the 
incremental load depends on other settings (mainly **Primary Key**).
- **Delimiter** and **Enclosure** specify the CSV settings.

### Header & Primary Key

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Header & Primary Key](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui7.png)

There are three options for determining column names: 

 - **Set header manually** --- This option enables the **Set Header** input to manually specify all columns in the table.
 - **Read from the file(s) header** --- This option assumes that each file has a header on the first line. 
 A random file will be chosen to extract the header and the first line in all files will be removed.
 - **Generate automatically** --- The columns will be named sequentially as `col_1`, `col_2` and so on.

**Primary Key** can be used to specify the primary key in Storage, which can be used with **Incremental Load** 
and **New Files Only** to create a configuration that incrementally loads all new files into a table in Storage. 


### Audit

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Audit](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui8.png)

The extractor can optionally add audit columns to the table. `s3_filename` adds the processed file name and `s3_row_number` 
adds the row number in the source file. 

## Advanced

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Advanced](/extractors/other/aws-s3/ui10.png)

For more features, switch the configuration of each table to the **Power User Mode** by clicking the *Open JSON editor* link.
Through editing the full JSON configuration you can set up the component (all options 
described in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/keboola/aws-s3-extractor)) and also the 
processors (to learn more about processors, see the [Developers Docs](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/docker-runner/processors/)).

Changing the JSON configuration may render the visual form unable to represent the configuration, and switching back may 
be disabled. Reverting such changes will re-enable the visual form. But whenever possible, the JSON will translate back 
to the visual form and vice versa. 

## Limitations

- The extractor can only download 1,000 files at once. For downloading more files, please use the **New Files Only** feature 
and run the configuration multiple times.
- All files stored in [AWS Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) are ignored.
